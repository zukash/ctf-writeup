<excuse me, but Real Programmers use butterflies. They open their hands and let the delicate wings flap once. The disturbances ripple outward, changing the flow of the eddy currents in the upper atmosphere. These cause momentary pockets of higher-pressure air to form, Which act as lenses that deflect incoming cosmic rays, focusing them to strike the drive platter and flip the desired bit. Nice. 'Course, there's an emacs command to do that. Oh yeah! Good ol' C-x M-c M-butterfly... Dammit, Emacs.
